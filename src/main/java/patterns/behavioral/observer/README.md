#### Observer Design Pattern

```
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, 
called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems, in "event driven" software. Most modern languages such as 
Java and C# have built in "event" constructs which implement the observer pattern components, for easy programming and short code.
