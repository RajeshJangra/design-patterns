#### Iterator Design Patterns
##### Definition
```$xslt
Iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's 
elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily 
container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.
