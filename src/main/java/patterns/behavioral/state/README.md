#### State Design Patterns

##### Definition

Implements a state machine in an object-oriented way. 
* State machine is implemented by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern interface 
* State transitions are acted out by invoking methods on implementing classes

* Encapsulates varying behavior for the same object based on its internal state. 
* Cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without resorting to conditional statements
