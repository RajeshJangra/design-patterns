# Gang of Four Design Patterns

#### Creational Patterns
  * **Abstract Factory:**	Creating an instance of family of products
  * **Builder:**	Finding a solution to telescoping constructor antipattern
  * **Factory:** Creating an instance of product
  * **Prototype:**	Cloning an instance
  * **Singleton:**	Only a single instance of a class can exist
  
#### Structural Patterns
  * **Adapter:**	Match interfaces of different classes
  * **Bridge:**	Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
  * **Composite:**	A tree structure of simple and composite objects
  * **Decorator:**	Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
  * **Facade:**	A single class that represents an entire subsystem
  * **Flyweight:**	A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
  * **Proxy:**	An object representing another object

Behavioral Patterns
  * **Chain of Responsibility:**	A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
  * **Command:**	Encapsulate a command request as an object
  * **Interpreter:**	A way to include language elements in a program
  * **Iterator:**	Sequentially access the elements of a collection
  * **Mediator:**	Defines simplified communication between classes
  * **Memento:**	Capture and restore an object's internal state
  * **Observer:**	A way of notifying change to a number of classes
  * **State:**	Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
  * **Strategy:**	Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
  * **Template Method:**	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
  * **Visitor:**	Defines a new operation to a class without change
