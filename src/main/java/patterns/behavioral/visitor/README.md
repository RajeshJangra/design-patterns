#### Visitor Design Patterns
##### Definition
```$xslt
Visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. 
A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to extant object structures without 
modifying the structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.

In essence, the visitor allows adding new virtual functions to a family of classes, without modifying the classes. 
Instead, a visitor class is created that implements all of the appropriate specializations of the virtual function. 
The visitor takes the instance reference as input, and implements the goal through double dispatch.
