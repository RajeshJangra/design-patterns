#### Template Method Design Patterns

##### Definition

Defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, delegating some steps to subclasses. 

* Subclasses can override certain steps but the skeleton remains same.
* Base class defines the steps and subclasses implement them.
* Used if two components have similarities but no logical interfaces can be extracted.
