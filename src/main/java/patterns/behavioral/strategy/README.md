#### Strategy Design Patterns
##### Definition
```$xslt
strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an 
algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. 

The strategy pattern

1. defines a family of algorithms,
2. encapsulates each algorithm, and
3. makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.

Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it
