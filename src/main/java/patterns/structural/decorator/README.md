#### Decorator Design Pattern

##### Definition

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 

* Provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
* Embellishing of a core object by recursively wrapping it.
* Adheres to the SRP, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern
