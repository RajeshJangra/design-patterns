#### Mediator Design Pattern

```angular2html
With the mediator pattern, communication between objects is encapsulated within a mediator object. 
Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. 
This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing coupling.
